# Excel calendar to iCalendar events

The last couple of years I used a self build calendar in an Excel file. It brought me more possibilities around the basic calendar view. Now, I wanted to be able to go through my Apple iCalendar App and see what I experienced the last month.
For that I needed to download the Excel file, do a few transformations to the original table, grap the important information, bring it into the correct form and then save them to an '.ics' file.
